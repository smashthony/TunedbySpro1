      <h2>Built by Passion. Tuned with Precision. Delivered Anywhere.</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Tuned By Spro</strong>, a fully remote custom-tuning service created for real enthusiasts who want real results. This platform was born from late nights in my own garage, tuning my K24A-swapped RSX by trial, error, and obsession. After dialing in builds for friends and strangers across the country, I realized most people were stuck using basemaps that didn’t fit their setup, paying too much at shops, or struggling to get clean results on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s where this comes in. Whether you're stock, mildly modified, or fully built — I offer remote tuning services tailored specifically to your K-Series engine. I don’t believe in one-size-fits-all. Every car is different, and so is every tune I build. From eco-focused maps to aggressive pop/crackle calibrations, everything is crafted based on your hardware, driving style, and goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not just about sending a file. I’ll personally walk you through the entire process — flashing your ECU with <strong>Hondata K-Pro</strong>, explaining how to read and monitor <strong>AFR (Air-Fuel Ratio)</strong> data, and guiding you on adjustments based on datalogs. Think of me as your remote co-pilot, helping you get the most out of your setup safely and reliably.
      </p>
      <p>
        My focus is drivability, efficiency, and safe power. No rushed jobs, no generic maps. If you care about making your K-Series perform like it should — whether you're dailying, racing, or somewhere in between — you're in the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s get your car running better than ever — together.
